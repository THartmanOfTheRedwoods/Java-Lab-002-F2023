### Part 2 - Interpretation
Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section of the README.md file listing the:
* Variable name
* Its data type
* and example values you can assign them.

Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are **WRONG** and explain why.
* Hint: your IDE can help you discover wrong assignments or variable names!

### Part 3 - Bonus: Play around with Java String Format Specifiers.

Pick several of the Java format specifiers below and define variables of the correct type utilize **sout** and **String.format** to view the resulting formats.

### Part 4 - Submission
* Just as you did last week (Reference the Lab video in your Week 1 module), create a Feature1 branch of your code
* Commit your working code to your local copy
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub: Feature1 -> origin/Feature1)
* Then issue a Pull request to my instructor branch
    * Make sure to **COPY** the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab/assignment.
