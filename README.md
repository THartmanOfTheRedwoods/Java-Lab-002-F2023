# Java-Lab-002

## Variables, Types and Operators

Be able to explain what variables are. Understand variable types, allowed names, and valid values.
Know how to create and use string, integer, floating-point, and boolean variables.

### Part 1 - LikeAGirl.java - [Like a Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yLXrWLvwAo)

The lab template contains a program that prints the following if you choose "0":
```
What does it mean to do something, "Like a Girl"?
Show me what it looks like to run, "Like a Girl."
Show me what it looks like to fight, "Like a Girl."
How do you think it affects them when somebody uses "Like a Girl" as an insult? Choice (good: 0, bad: 1) 0
You answered 0
Always wants to change that.
Emotional Damage 100.000000.
Did you answer like a nice person? FALSE
```
... OR the following if you choose "1":
```
What does it mean to do something, "Like a Girl"?
Show me what it looks like to run, "Like a Girl."
Show me what it looks like to fight, "Like a Girl."
How do you think it affects them when somebody uses "Like a Girl" as an insult? Choice (good: 0, bad: 1) 1
You answered 1
Good for you.
Emotional Damage 0.000000.
Did you answer like a nice person? TRUE
```

Ignore the code that you don't fully recognize and concentrate on changing the variables to alter the script to say the following if 1 is chosen:
```
What does it mean to do something, "Like a Boy"?
Show me what it looks like to run, "Like a Boy."
Show me what it looks like to fight, "Like a Boy."
How do you think it affects them when somebody uses "Like a Boy" as an insult? Choice (good: 1, bad: 2) 1
You answered 1
Good for you.
Emotional Damage 50.000000.
Did you answer like a nice person? TRUE
```
OR to say the following if 2 is chosen:
```
What does it mean to do something, "Like a Boy"?
Show me what it looks like to run, "Like a Boy."
Show me what it looks like to fight, "Like a Boy."
How do you think it affects them when somebody uses "Like a Boy" as an insult? Choice (good: 1, bad: 2) 2
You answered 2
Always wants to change that.
Emotional Damage 100.000000.
Did you answer like a nice person? FALSE
```

### Part 2 - Interpretation
Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section of the README.md file listing the:
* Variable name
* Its data type
* and example values you can assign them.
* "scriptTemplateLine1" - string - "abc"
* "good" - int - "123"
* "emotionalDamage" - float - "decimals and negatives, 32 bit size"
* "dEmotionalDamage" - double - "decimals and negatives like float, but 64 bit size"
* "trueOrFalse" - boolean - "1 or 0, true or false"
* "s" - scanner - "System.in"
Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are **WRONG** and explain why.
* Hint: your IDE can help you discover wrong assignments or variable names!
int Main = "Hello" (You can't name a variable the same as the class name and you can't assign a string to an int)
string float = "12" + "3" (Can't use keywords for variable names and this math won't work like you want, this will concatonate and give you "123" not add those two numbers) 
### Part 3 - Bonus: Play around with Java String Format Specifiers.

Pick several of the Java format specifiers below and define variables of the correct type utilize **sout** and **String.format** to view the resulting formats.

### Part 4 - Submission
* Just as you did last week (Reference the Lab video in your Week 1 module), create a Feature1 branch of your code
* Commit your working code to your local copy
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub: Feature1 -> origin/Feature1)
* Then issue a Pull request to my instructor branch
    * Make sure to **COPY** the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab/assignment.
